Sorting Algorithms form one of the canonical subcategories of algorithms
as a whole. Here I shall deal with a few of them, firstly summarizing each below:

|    Algorithm   |                  Time                  |  Space  | Use Cases |
|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------:|:-------:|:---------:|
| Selection Sort |            O(n<sup>2</sup>)            |   O(1)  |           |
| Insertion Sort |            O(n<sup>2</sup>)            |   O(1)  |           |
|   Bubble Sort  |            O(n<sup>2</sup>)            |   O(1)  |           |
|   Merge Sort   |                O(nlogn)                |   O(n)  |           |
|   Quick Sort   | O(nlogn) avg  / O(n<sup>2</sup>) worst | O(logn) |           |
|   Radix Sort   |                  O(nk)                 |  O(n+k) |           |
