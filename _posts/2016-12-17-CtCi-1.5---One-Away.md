**Question:**
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character and replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are within one edit of each other.


**Solution:**  
{% highlight python %}
def checkReplace(s1,s2):
  """
  True if strings s1 and s2 are one
  char replacement away from being
  identical
  """
  diffs = 0
  for i in range(len(s1)):
    if (s1[i] != s2[i]):
      diffs += 1
    if (diffs > 1):
      return False

  return True

def checkRemoveInsert(s1,s2):
  """
  True if strings s1 and s2 are one
  insertion / removal away from
  being identical
  """
  diffs = 0
  greater = s1 if (len(s1) > len(s2)) else s2
  idx1 = 0
  idx2 = 0
  while ((idx1 < len(s1)) and (idx2 < len(s2))):
    # diff chars -> incr diffs, move longer forward
    if (s1[idx1] != s2[idx2]):
      diffs += 1
      if (greater == s1):
        idx1 += 1
      else:
        idx2 += 1
    # same chars -> move both forward
    else:
      idx1 += 1
      idx2 += 1
    if (diffs > 1):
      return False

  return True



def isOneAway(s1,s2):
  """
  True if strings s1 and s2 are one
  'edit' away from being equivalent
  """
  len1 = len(s1)
  len2 = len(s2)
  diff = abs(len1-len2)

  # impossible to be one away
  if (diff > 1):
    return False

  # only replacement works
  if (diff == 0):
    return checkReplace(s1,s2)
  # only remove / insert works        
  else:
    return checkRemoveInsert(s1,s2)
{% endhighlight %}
