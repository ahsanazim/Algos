**Question:**
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the sting `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z)

**Solution:**  
{% highlight python %}
def appendToCompr(arr,ch,streak):
  """ appends ch and streak to arr """
  arr.append(ch)
  arr.append(str(streak))
  return arr

def compressStr(s):
  # build up list of chars
  compressed = []   

  streak = 0
  prev = ''

  for idx, ch in enumerate(s):
    # special case for first char
    if (idx == 0):
      prev = ch
      streak = 0  # will be incremented shortly

    # same chars, increment streak
    if (ch == prev):
      streak += 1    
      # is last char in string, add to compressed
      if (idx == (len(s) - 1)):
        compressed = appendToCompr(compressed,prev,streak)

    # diff chars --> add to str, start new streak
    else:
      compressed = appendToCompr(compressed,prev,streak)
      prev = ch
      streak = 1

  if (len(compressed) >= len(s)):
    return s
  else:
    return ''.join(compressed)     # converts to string
{% endhighlight %}


Note that the use of a list of characters avoids the need to perform an expensive
O(n<sup>2</sup>) string concatenation at every step. At the end we simply convert the array of strings
in to a string by performing a join with `''` between each character.

This then genuinely runs in O(n) time, compared to the O(p + k<sup>2</sup>) we
would've had previously.
