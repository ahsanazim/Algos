**Question:**
Given an array `S` of n integers, are there elements `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in `S` such that `a + b + c + d = target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

```
For example, given array S = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

**Solution:**  

The solution for 4Sum follows easily from that of 3Sum and the like.

Firstly, consider a solution that uses a `set()` to avoid duplicates:

{% highlight python %}
def fourSum(nums, target):
  n = len(nums)
  nums = sorted(nums)
  sols = set()

  if (len(nums) < 4):     # no quadruples possible
    return []

  for i in range(0,n-3):  # 1st to 4th-last element
    for j in range(i+1,n-2): # i+1 to last
      l = j+1
      r = n-1
      while (l < r):
        sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[l] + nums[r]
        if (sum == target):
          sols.add((nums[i],nums[j],nums[l],nums[r]))
          l += 1
          r -= 1
        elif (sum < target):
          l += 1
        else:
          r -= 1

  return list(sols)     # convert set to list
{% endhighlight %}


Now consider a more ***space-efficient***, ***alternate, solution*** that relies exclusively on pointers to avoid duplicates:

{% highlight python %}
def fourSum(nums, target):
  n = len(nums)
  nums = sorted(nums)
  sols = []

  if (len(nums) < 4):     # no quadruples possible
    return []

  # 1st to 4th-last element
  for i in range(0,n-3):  
    if (i != 0) and (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]):   
      continue             
    # i+1 to last  
    for j in range(i+1,n-2):
      if (j != i + 1) and (nums[j] == nums[j - 1]):   
        continue      
      l = j+1
      r = n-1
      while (l < r):
        sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[l] + nums[r]
        if (sum == target):
          sols.append([nums[i],nums[j],nums[l],nums[r]])
          # avoid duplicates - stops at last identical l,r
          while (l < r) and (nums[l] == nums[l + 1]):
              l += 1
          while (l < r) and (nums[r] == nums[r - 1]):
              r -= 1
          l += 1
          r -= 1
        elif (sum < target):
          l += 1
        else:
          r -= 1

  return sols
{% endhighlight %}

Avoiding duplicates in a 4-sum situation proved tricky, and required a decent amount of trial
and error. Definitely something to look over a few times - especially the `j != i + 1` part; the crucial item to note here is that we use the former instead of `j != 1`.

[This](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/22705/python-140ms-beats-100-and-works-for-n-sum-n-2/2) link seems to have an interesting more general solution.

One special item to keep note of is the use of `continue` instead of `i += 1` in
the `if` statement at the top of the for loop. Note that python `for` loops are
essentially `forEach` loops, and changing the value of the iterating variable will
not have the same effect as it would in C-style for loops. Indeed, `for i in range(0,3)`
basically means `for i in [0,1,2]`.
